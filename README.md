# Internet protocol suite
A conceptual model and set of [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) used on the 
Internet and similar [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)

Commonly referred to as TCP/IP as foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

The Department of Defense (DoD) model, because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.

# World Wide Web
The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are usually accessed using HTTP, which is one of many Internet communication protocols.[
