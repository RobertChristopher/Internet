# Internet protocol suite
A conceptual model and set of [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) used on the 
Internet and similar [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)

Commonly referred to as TCP/IP as foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

The Department of Defense (DoD) model, because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.
